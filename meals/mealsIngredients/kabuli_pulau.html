        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the rice: Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onions and cook until golden brown. Add cumin seeds, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaves. Saute for 30 seconds until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the meat (optional): If using lamb or beef, add to the pot and brown on all sides. Add enough water to cover the meat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until meat is tender. Remove and set aside, reserving the broth. If using chicken, add it later in step 4.

            </li>
            <li>Simmer the rice: Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot with the spices and onion. Season with salt. Pour in reserved broth (or water if no meat was used) to cover the rice by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until rice is cooked and fluffy. Do not peek during this time!

            </li>
            <li>Fluff and assemble: Once cooked, turn off heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice gently with a fork, removing the cloves and bay leaves. If using chicken, add it at this point and gently fold it into the rice.
            </li>
            <li>Add final touches: Stir in raisins, carrots, toasted almonds, and pistachios (if using). Garnish with chopped cilantro (optional).

            </li>Serve: Enjoy your Kabuli Pulao hot with your favorite accompaniments like naan, yogurt, or chutney.
