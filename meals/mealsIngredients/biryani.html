        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in enough water for at least 30 minutes. Drain and keep aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, add the rice, water, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook for about 15 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add bay leaves, cardamoms, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Fry for about 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Remove from pan and keep aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add chicken pieces and sprinkle salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala powder. Mix well and cook for about 5 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Add chopped onions, grated ginger, minced garlic, and chopped green chilies (if using). Cook for another minute or until the onions are translucent. Remove from heat and keep aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or a deep baking dish, spread half of the cooked rice at the bottom. Arrange the chicken mixture over the rice layer. Spread remaining rice over the chicken layer evenly. Garnish with fried onions and coriander leaves. Cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil and let it rest for at least 10 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld together.</li>
